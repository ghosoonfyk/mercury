# MERCURY PLATFORM
​
​
### INTRODUCTION
Mercury Platform The Coronavirus pandemic has changed how millions around the globe are educated and has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities, and colleges. In response to school closures and the side effect of the pandemic,  we decided to make a Mercury Platform which is providing different courses in computer science with the best teachers to make it easier to get the knowledge from a  world where anyone,  anywhere has the power to transform their lives through learning. Here, you will learn and earn!
